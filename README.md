## Scripts to farm for paragons/monkeys

### IMPORTANT
- The script for Paragon/monkey XP farming only works with 1920x1080 resolution. Therefore, it's recommended to just change the settings within the BTD6 to display that resolution so that the coordinates work as intended. If you are persistent and want to make it work on another resolution. You would have to adjust the different x and y coordinates of the different mouse clicks within the script. How? You can use the mouse pointer script, which opens another window where you can see the mouse coordinates.
- This scripts was created for the deflation rounds

The paragon script is commented, so that it should be fairly easy to follow and understand so that you can create your own setup. If you dont want to be bothered with code i created a setup for each paragon (as of 27/08/2024). The Tack Shooter paragon would be uploaded later

## Scripts for Minecraft

### IMPORTANT for autofishing
You need to make sure that you can alt+tab without minecraft pause the game and that windows has enabled animation as we need the sound animation in volumne mixer.

To make sure you can alt+tab
1. Go into %appdata%.minecraft
2. find the file options.txtopen in any text editor
3. find the line: pause_on_lost_focus
4. set this value to false

To enable animation effects
1. Go into windows settings
2. Animations effects
3. enable effects

I have learned that have minecraft in window mode and then the volumne mixer window overlapping the minecraft window a bit. Which makes it easier to see and follow the focus of the window.

The 3 other scripts are fairly simple and were created to AFK mine on a cobble generator, slaying mobs at a mob farm and automatically catching fish. All on a sky block server (Can proberly also be used in single player and other scenarios)
The scripts have comments so that it should be easy to understand and how to use the toggle.
