# Scripts

## Scripts to farm for paragons/monkeys

### IMPORTANT
- The script for Paragon/monkey XP farming only works with 1920x1080 resolution. Therefore, it's recommended to just change the settings within the BTD6 to display that resolution so that the coordinates work as intended. If you are persistent and want to make it work on another resolution. You would have to adjust the different x and y coordinates of the different mouse clicks within the script. How? You can use the mouse pointer script, which opens another window where you can see the mouse position.
- This script only works when you already have a setup, like in deflation rounds.

### The script works like this

## Scripts for Minecraft

These scripts are fairly simple and were created to AFK mine on a cobble generator, slaying mobs at a mob farm and automatically catching fish. All on a sky block server (Can proberly also be used in single player and other scenarios)
